@ Example Blog Post

This is an example blog post formatted using our newly
designed markup language. It is used to demostrate the
various features available right now, such as:

- Headers
- Paragraphs
- Unordered and Ordered lists

The are a few more features that could be added to make
this language a bit more useful, like code blocks, more
headers, links and images. But we will keep it small for
now. You are welcomed to implement the features you are
interested in!

This project was made to demonstrate how to build simple
programs using Haskell. We took (or will take) the
following steps in this tutorial:

# Create a small HTML generator EDSL
# Defined our markup language and implemented a parser for it
# Glue both parts together
# Reading blog posts from file and outputing html to another file
# Adding a cleaner cli interface using libraries

I hope someone will find this project useful!
