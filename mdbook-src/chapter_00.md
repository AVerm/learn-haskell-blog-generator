# About this tutorial

> Note: This is WIP

In this tutorial we will implement a very simple static blog generator in Haskell, converting documents written in our own custom markup language to html.

We will:

1. Implement a tiny HTML printer library
2. Define and parse our custom markup language
3. Read files and glue things together
4. Add command line arguments parsing
5. Alternatively serve the blog over http

In each chapter of the book we will focus on a particular task we wish to achieve, and through the chapter we'll learn just enough Haskell to complete the task.

This book is an alternatively presentation of:
[soupi/learn-haskell-blog-generator](https://github.com/soupi/learn-haskell-blog-generator), which presents the chapters one commit at a time.
